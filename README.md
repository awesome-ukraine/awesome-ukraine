# Awesome Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

This is a terrible time now. It's war. And this war destroys Ukrainians, Ukrainian architecture, culture, and everything people like about Ukraine all over the world.
The Russian and Belorussian repression government brutally cuts down any protests or even messages if such a message is different than an official statement.

We created this repository for all IT people who want to support Ukrainians now by remembering their favorite things about this Awesome country.
Make your minimal commitment to a peaceful future:

1. Star project
2. Make fork
3. Commit your loved thing of Ukraine in any creative way and pull request

## Science

- [Maryna Viazovska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryna_Viazovska) - solved the sphere-packing problem in dimension 8 and, in collaboration with others, in dimension 24. Previously, the problem had been solved only for three or fewer dimensions, and the proof of the three-dimensional version (the Kepler conjecture) involved long computer calculations. In contrast, Viazovska's proof for 8 and 24 dimensions is "stunningly simple".
